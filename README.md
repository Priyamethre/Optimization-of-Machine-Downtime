# Optimization of Machine Downtime

# Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning and data analytics to minimize machine downtime in a manufacturing setting, aiming to enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs. The project combines statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization techniques to provide actionable insights that aid in preventing and reducing downtime.

# Key Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For handling numerical operations
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization
Scikit-Learn: For building predictive models

# Predictive Modeling
Trained multiple models, including Decision Trees and Random Forest, to predict downtime events. The Random Forest model achieved a high accuracy of 95%, helping to forecast downtime events effectively.

# Optimization & Results
Achieved a reduction in machine downtime by 10%, meeting the project goal. This was accomplished by refining maintenance schedules and applying machine learning insights to adjust operational practices.

# Future Work

Real-Time Monitoring: Integrate real-time monitoring for predictive maintenance.
Advanced Analytics: Employ deep learning and time series models for dynamic downtime prediction.
Cost Analysis: Analyze the financial impact of downtime reduction on operational budgets to further optimize maintenance investments.
